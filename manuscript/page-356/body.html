self-deceived, Miller; your prejudice has warped your judgment. The

innocent, his people can console themselves with the reflection that
Mrs. Ochiltree was also innocent, and balance one crime against the
other, the white against the black. Of course I shall take no part in
whatever may be done,â€”but it is not my affair, nor yours. Take my
advice, Miller, and keep out of it.'</p></div> </div>
