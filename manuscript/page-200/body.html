cry of alarm.</p><p>At the moment when Mrs. Carteret had turned away from the window, and
while Mammy Jane was watching Janet, Clara had taken a step forward, and
was leaning against the window-sill. The baby, convulsed with delight,

inarticulate scream, but retained self-possession enough to reach down

over the brick pavement below.</p><p>"Oh, Clara, Clara, how could you!" exclaimed Mrs. Carteret
reproachfully; "you might have killed my child!"</p></div> </div>
