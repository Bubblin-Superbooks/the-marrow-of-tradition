should personally like to have him with us to-night. But—I ought to
have told you this before, but I couldn't very well do so, on such
short notice, in Miller's presence—we are a conservative people, and
our local customs are not very flexible. We jog along in much the same
old way our fathers did. I'm not at all sure that Major Carteret or the
other gentlemen would consent to the presence of a negro doctor."</p><p>"I think you misjudge your own people," returned Dr. Burns, "they are
broader than you think. We have our prejudices against the negro at the
North, but we do not let them stand in the way of anything that <em>we</em>
want. At any rate, it is too late now, and I will accept the
responsibility. If the question is raised, I will attend to it. When I
am performing an operation I must be <em>aut Caesar, aut nullus</em>."</p></div> </div>
