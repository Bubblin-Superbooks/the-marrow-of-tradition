rival. Ellis had no grievance against the "aristocracy" of Wellington.
The "best people" had received him cordially, though his father had not
been of their caste; but Ellis hated a hypocrite, and despised a coward,
and he felt sure that Delamere was both. Otherwise he would have
struggled against his love for Clara Pemberton. His passion for her had
grown with his appreciation of Delamere's unworthiness. As a friend of
the family, he knew the nature and terms of the engagement, and that if
the marriage took place at all, it would not be for at least a year.
This was a long time,â€”many things might happen in a year, especially to
a man like Tom Delamere. If for any reason Delamere lost his chance,

he had missed no opportunity of meeting her and making himself quietly
and unobtrusively agreeable.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">On the day after this encounter with Delamere on</p></div> </div>
