that he was called to your house once before, by a third person who
claimed authority to act, and that he was refused admittance. He
declares that he will not consider such a call unless it come from you
personally."</p><p>"That is true, quite true," replied Carteret. "His position is a just
one. I will go at once. Will—will—my child live until I can get Miller
here?"</p><p>"He can live for half an hour without an operation. Beyond that I could
give you little hope."</p><p>Seizing his hat, Carteret dashed out of the yard and ran rapidly to
Miller's house; ordinarily a walk of six or seven minutes, Carteret
covered it in three, and was almost out of breath when he rang the bell
of Miller's front door.</p><p>The ring was answered by the doctor in person.</p></div> </div>
